# Project Box

A simple android app built using adroid studio. The idea of the app was for users that are researchers and software applications developers, enabling them to add research/project description and upload a research paper/ project report. 
Users can add, update, delete their posts and can also search for project/research posts from other users. Enabling them to build a community where people with common interest can help each other, share thoughts, discuss ideas and communicate with each other.

I built this project back in 2017.
